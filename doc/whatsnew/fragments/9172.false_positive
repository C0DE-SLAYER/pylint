Fixed `unnecessary-comprehension provides incorrect suggestion`

Example of the suggetion:
#pylint: disable=missing-module-docstring
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [x for x in a]
b[0] = 0
print(a) # [1, 2, 3]

After changing b = [x for x in a] to b = a based on the suggestion, the script now prints [0, 2, 3]. The correct suggestion should be use list(a) to preserve the original behavior.

Closes #9172
